# 🏗️ Project Under Development 

The Final Lap (working title) is an app that allows Formula 1 enthusiasts to view each current driver's historical and in-season results, allowing them to make informed predictions about the outcome of the next race. There are many resources online that show things like total wins, podiums, poles, fastest laps, etc., but these are just counting numbers that don't provide any context to a fan about the current competitive order. Instead, The Final Lap focuses on 3 key variables: 
1.	The driver's in-season results, with an emphasis on the last 5 races, as a driver's car can get relatively faster or slower over a season.
2.	The driver's history at the track. Some drivers perform better in slower street circuits, some prefer faster circuits.
3.	The driver's recent results at that track-type. Each track will be coded into a category that emphasizes an attribute (power, aerodynamics, etc.) Certain driver/car combinations thrive on tracks that reward top speed, others excel in technical, twisty layouts.
   
# 🏁 MVP Features (minimum viable product)
<li>A dashboard on the main page, which gives at-a-glance info at each driver’s last 5 race results in 3 categories: Current form (last 5 races contested), Track history (last 5 races contested at the upcoming track), and Circuit Type (last 5 races contested on track layouts that are similar to the upcoming track).</li>
<li>Each driver will have a profile page, providing full career race results in the same categories featured in the dashboard.</li>


# 🏁 Additional Features (will add to project if development time allows)
<li>Contextual results: all results are measured against that driver’s in-season average, and color-coded green or red if they are significantly better or worse than normal. This makes it easier to see when a driver’s form is improving/declining, excels/ struggles at particular tracks, track-types, etc.</li>
<li>Qualifying results in same categories mentioned above.</li>
<li>Results in rain-affected races. (Some drivers excel or struggle in the wet)</li>
<li>Weather predictor – widget that has up-to-date forecast for upcoming race weekend.</li>
<li>Team stats for in-season results (historical data is not as useful: team competitiveness and car characteristics fluctuate season-to-season)</li>
<li>Race Reports: See a strange result and need the full story? Click on a driver’s race result for direct link to that race’s Wikipedia page.</li>
<li>Results for fastest laps, fastest pitstops, practice sessions. Probabilities for safety cars, red flags at upcoming track.</li>

# 🏁 Target Audience
<li>Sports betting is huge, and F1 has a rapidly growing profile. Place your bet with (relative) confidence.</li>
<li>F1, like any sport, has fantasy leagues and pools. Make informed predictions with ease.</li>
<li>Long-term enthusiasts who just like to geek out about this stuff.</li>
<li>New fans who watched Drive to Survive and want to know what's going on when they sit down to watch a race.</li>
